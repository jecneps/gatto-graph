- "During the eighteen months from July 1950 through December 1951, just over 2 million Selective Service registrants were examined for induction. Of this number about 1.3 million were accepted and slightly more than 700,000 rejected. More than half of all those rejected. 54 percent, had failed to pass the new mental examination called the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)."5: The study indicated that there was no mystery in these failures. "A study of their examination papers revealed that they had been able to read only haltingly and they therefore completed but a small number of questions. They had attended school for a number of years, varying from three to eight, but it had been a long time since they had read a book or taken an examination. They repeatedly stated that they were 'not much on reading books,' but they thought they know more and could do more than they had demonstrated on the test. There is no doubt that they were right, for this was the only possible conclusion after a study of their civilian work records." "
